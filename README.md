## Project description
The project is meant to evaluate the use of the RUST programming language to implement high speed data accusition on the NXP LPC43XX, 200Mhz M4/M0 multicore microcontroller. Project done in connection with Grepit AB. The parts that will be worked on in this project is first to get the dual core system up and running. A connection between the microcontroller and an external PC will have to be implemented to be able to transfer data between these units. Control of the ADC is to be implemented which is the hardware unit that will mainly be used for the oscilloscope. To be able to use the ADC at the intended speeds an efficient implementation of a DMA configuration will also have to be implemented. The project will be done at 25% during lecturing periods two and three.

## Grading goals
### Grade 3:
For a grade 3 ....

#### Testing and experimenting on the device is to be done to see what parts need to be worked on and to find possible problems concerning the implementation of the ADC and it's neccesary subsystems. 

e.g. Using RUST to implement the connection to the ADC we should be able to connect to this hardware unit and read data from it, speed do not matter and neither does resolution or data processing/storage.

e.g. Implementing the above  (in the project description) given parts, in RUST, separate of each other so that each is can be used but that no framework for connecting it all together exists. 

Johans suggestion:
Either ADC or pc communication functionality



### Grade 4:
For a grade 4 ....

#### A plan for how to deal with the task in an efficient way, based on the RUST languages attributes/memory model, is to be found. Implementation of the ADC should be done based on this plan and the result of the previous experiments. Creating tests that should tell if the implementation is a valid one, based on the facts the we would like to achieve an ADC that can sample/transfer data at speeds of 80 MSPS at 12bits of resolution.

Johans suggestion:
Complete functionality of the system




### Grade 5:
For a grade 5 ....

#### Create a solution and perform testing of it, to make the neccesary evaluation of whatever it works.

Johans suggestion:
Decent abstraction of the drivers
