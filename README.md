## Project description
The project is meant to evaluate the use of the RUST programming language to implement high speed data accusition on the NXP LPC4370, 200Mhz M4/M0 multicore microcontroller. Project done in connection with Grepit AB. The parts that will be worked on in this project is first to get the dual core system up and running. A connection between the microcontroller and an external PC will have to be implemented to be able to transfer data between these units. Control of the ADC is to be implemented which is the hardware unit that will mainly be used for the oscilloscope. To be able to use the ADC at the intended speeds an efficient implementation of a DMA configuration will also have to be implemented. The project will be done at 25% during lecturing periods two and three.

## Grading goals
### Grade 3:
For a grade 3 ....

#### Testing and experimenting on the device is to be done to see what parts need to be worked on and to find possible problems concerning the implementation of the ADC and it's neccesary subsystems. Creating a proof of concept, show whatever it's possible to complete the given task. 

e.g. Using RUST to implement the connection to the ADC we should be able to connect to this hardware unit and read data from it, speed do not matter and neither does resolution or data processing/storage.

e.g. Implementing the above  (in the project description) given parts, in RUST, separate of each other so that each is can be used but that no framework for connecting it all together exists. 

Johans suggestion:
Either ADC or pc communication functionality



### Grade 4:
For a grade 4 ....

#### A plan for how to implement an efficient API, based on the RUST language model is to be created.

Johans suggestion:
Complete functionality of the system


### Grade 5:
For a grade 5 ....

#### Implement the API solution and perform testing of it. Design relevant test cases to prove that the criterias are met and also create simple examples that will show how that the implementation fulfills the API plan. 

Johans suggestion:
Decent abstraction of the drivers
